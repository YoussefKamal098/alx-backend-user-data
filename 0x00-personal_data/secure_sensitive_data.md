## 1. What is Hashing?

Hashing is a one-way process that converts data of any size into a fixed-size hash. This transformation is irreversible,
which makes it useful for securely storing sensitive data like passwords. Hashes have the following properties:

- **Fixed Length**: The output has a consistent length.
- **Deterministic**: The same input yields the same hash.
- **Irreversible**: Original data canâ€™t be retrieved from the hash.
- **Unique**: Unique inputs produce unique hashes.

---

## 2. Common Hashing Algorithms

### MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)
MD5 generates a 128-bit hash. However,
it is **not recommended for security purposes** anymore because it's vulnerable to collision attacks,
where two different inputs can produce the same hash.

**Example in Python:**
```python
import hashlib
data = "Sensitive Information"
hash_md5 = hashlib.md5(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("MD5:", hash_md5)
```

### SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
SHA-1 produces a 160-bit hash and is more secure than MD5. However,
it is also vulnerable to collisions and is no longer recommended for cryptographic security.

**Example in Python:**
```python
hash_sha1 = hashlib.sha1(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("SHA-1:", hash_sha1)
```

### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
SHA-256 is a part of the SHA-2 family and generates a 256-bit hash,
offering much stronger security. It is widely used in encryption standards today.


**Example in Python:**
```python
hash_sha256 = hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("SHA-256:", hash_sha256)
```

### Other SHA Algorithms (SHA-512, SHA-224, etc.)
The SHA family includes various algorithms with different output lengths. SHA-512 provides even greater security but with a longer hash.

**Example in Python:**

```python
hash_sha512 = hashlib.sha512(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("SHA-512:", hash_sha512)
```
---

## 3. Python Libraries for Hashing

### hashlib
The hashlib library in Python provides easy access to common hashing algorithms.
It supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. This library is efficient for standard hashing purposes.

**Example:**
```python
import hashlib
data = "Secure Data"
hashed_data = hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("SHA-256 Hash:", hashed_data)
```

### cryptography
For more advanced cryptographic needs,
the cryptography library provides a broader range of tools for encryption, key management, and secure password hashing.

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

**Example of Key Derivation:**
```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
import os

password = b"password123"
salt = os.urandom(16)
kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(algorithm=hashes.SHA256(), length=32, salt=salt, iterations=100000)
key = kdf.derive(password)
print("Derived Key:", key)
```

## 4. Password Hashing and Salting

### Why Salting is Essential
Salting adds a unique, random value to each password before hashing. This prevents attackers from using precomputed hash tables (e.g., rainbow tables) to reverse-engineer passwords.

### Techniques for Password Hashing and Salting in Python

Using the bcrypt library in Python is a standard way to hash passwords with automatic salting.

#### Installation:

```bash
pip install bcrypt
````

#### Example of Password Hashing and Checking with bcrypt:

```python
import bcrypt

# Hashing a password
password = b"secure_password"
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())
print("Hashed Password:", hashed)

# Checking the password
is_correct = bcrypt.checkpw(password, hashed)
print("Password Match:", is_correct)
```

## 5. Comparing Hashing Techniques

| Algorithm | Length (Bits) | Speed     | Security       |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| MD5       | 128           | Fast      | Insecure      |
| SHA-1     | 160           | Moderate  | Insecure      |
| SHA-256   | 256           | Moderate  | Secure        |
| bcrypt    | Variable      | Moderate  | Highly Secure |

**Choosing the Right Algorithm**: Use SHA-256 or SHA-512 for general hashing and `bcrypt` or `PBKDF2HMAC` with a salt for password hashing to resist brute-force attacks.

---

## 6. Examples and Code Snippets

### Full Example with hashlib and cryptography for Secure Hashing

#### Using hashlib for SHA-256:

```python
import hashlib

data = "Secure Data"
sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("SHA-256 Hash:", sha256_hash)
```


#### Using cryptography for Secure Password Hashing (PBKDF2 with Salt):

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.kdf.pbkdf2 import PBKDF2HMAC
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import hashes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
import os

password = b"secure_password"
salt = os.urandom(16)

kdf = PBKDF2HMAC(
    algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
    length=32,
    salt=salt,
    iterations=100000,
    backend=default_backend()
)
hashed_password = kdf.derive(password)
print("PBKDF2-HMAC SHA-256 Hash:", hashed_password)
```

## 7. Protecting Against Rainbow Table and Dictionary Attacks

### Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a list of common passwords to guess the hash.
Attackers hash common words (like "password123") and compare them with stored hashes.

### Rainbow Table Attack
Rainbow tables are precomputed hash tables for common passwords, allowing attackers to find matches quickly.

### How Salting Defends Against These Attacks
1. **Unique Hashes**: Salting ensures that identical passwords produce unique hashes.
2. **Increased Complexity**: Attackers would need to regenerate rainbow tables for each unique salt.

**Example of Salting:**
```python
import os
salt = os.urandom(16)
salted_password = salt + password.encode()
hash_with_salt = hashlib.sha256(salted_password).hexdigest()
print("With Salt:", hash_with_salt)
```

---

## 8. Other Techniques for Data Protection

### Hashing Algorithms with Iterations
Algorithms like PBKDF2, bcrypt, and Argon2 use multiple iterations, increasing security by making brute-force attacks computationally expensive.

**Example in Python** (Using `bcrypt`):
```python
import bcrypt
password = b"hello123"
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())
print("Hashed with bcrypt:", hashed)
```

### Peppering
A "pepper" is a fixed secret stored securely on the server, adding an extra layer of security. Unlike salts, peppers are not stored with the hash.

**Example of Peppering:**
```python
pepper = "secret-pepper"
hash_with_pepper = hashlib.sha256((password + pepper).encode()).hexdigest()
print("Hashed with pepper:", hash_with_pepper)
```

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
2FA adds another layer of verification (like SMS or app-generated codes), providing protection even if a password is compromised.

### Encryption for Sensitive Data (AES, RSA)
Encryption secures sensitive data that may need decryption later. **AES** is a symmetric encryption algorithm, while **RSA** is an asymmetric one, often used for public-private key encryption.

**Example of AES Encryption with `cryptography` library:**
```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
encrypted_data = cipher_suite.encrypt(b"Sensitive Information")
print("Encrypted Data:", encrypted_data)
```

## 11. Protecting Against Attacks: Summary

With these techniques, you can significantly enhance security for sensitive data. Combining multiple layers of protection (like salting, peppering, and two-factor authentication) creates a robust security foundation that defends against attacks like rainbow tables, dictionary attacks, and brute-force attacks.

By understanding these principles, implementing salting, iterative hashing, encryption, and protective techniques like two-factor authentication, you build a strong defense system against modern data security threats.

## Summary

Securing sensitive data requires combining multiple protection techniques:

- Use **salting** and **iterative hashing** to protect passwords.
- Add **peppering** for extra security.
- Apply **encryption** for sensitive data beyond passwords.

A multi-layered approach provides robust security, making it harder for attackers to compromise your system. Implementing these strategies ensures that even if one layer is compromised, other layers continue to protect the data.
