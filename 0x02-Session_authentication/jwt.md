## Introduction to JWT

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for **stateless authentication** and **authorization** in modern web applications, especially in **API-based** architectures.

JWTs are **compact**, **URL-safe**, and are used to represent claims between two parties. They allow the server to authenticate and authorize users based on the information encoded in the token.

## JWT Structure and Formation

A JWT consists of three parts:
1. **Header**
2. **Payload**
3. **Signature**

Each part is separated by a dot (`.`) and is encoded in Base64Url. Let's break down each part.

### Header

The **header** contains metadata about the token, such as the signing algorithm (usually **HS256** or **RS256**) and the token type (which is typically "JWT").

Example Header (JSON):

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

- **alg**: The algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., HS256).
- **typ**: The type of token (JWT).

The header is Base64Url-encoded.

### Payload

The **payload** contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:
1. **Registered claims**: Predefined claims like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration), and `sub` (subject).
2. **Public claims**: Claims that can be used to share information (e.g., username, role).
3. **Private claims**: Custom claims agreed upon between parties.

Example Payload (JSON):

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1631225432
}
```

- **username**: The username of the user.
- **role**: The role of the user (e.g., admin, user).
- **exp**: The expiration time of the token in UNIX timestamp.

The payload is Base64Url-encoded.

### Signature

The **signature** is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't tampered with. To create the signature:
1. Take the encoded **header** and **payload**.
2. Combine them with a dot (`.`).
3. Sign the resulting string using the secret key and the algorithm specified in the header (e.g., **HS256**).

Example formula for the signature:
```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + 
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret_key)
```

The signature is Base64Url-encoded.

### Complete JWT Example

A typical JWT might look like this:
```
<encoded_header>.<encoded_payload>.<encoded_signature>
```

Example JWT (encoded):
```

```

## How JWT Works

1. **User Authentication**: 
   - The user logs in by providing their credentials (e.g., username and password).
   - The server validates the credentials.
   - If valid, the server generates a JWT containing the user's information and signs it with a secret key.

2. **Token Transmission**: 
   - The server sends the generated JWT to the client, which stores it (typically in local storage or cookies).
   - For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT in the **Authorization** header (as a Bearer token) with each request.

3. **Token Verification**: 
   - The server verifies the JWT by checking the signature against the secret key. If valid, the server grants access to the protected resource.

## Generating JWT in Flask

To generate a JWT in Flask, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install Flask PyJWT bcrypt
```

### Code Example

```python
import jwt
import bcrypt
import datetime
from functools import wraps
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'  # Secret key for signing JWTs

# In-memory users storage (for demonstration purposes)
users = {}

# Utility function to check user roles
def role_required(required_role):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
            if not token:
                return jsonify({"message": "Token is missing!"}), 401

            try:
                token = token.split(" ")[1]  # Split 'Bearer <token>'
                decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithms=["HS256"])
                request.user = decoded_token  # Store decoded token in request context
            except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
                return jsonify({"message": "Token has expired!"}), 403
            except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
                return jsonify({"message": "Invalid token!"}), 403

            # Check for the required role
            if request.user['role'] != required_role:
                return jsonify({"message": f"Access denied: {required_role}s only!"}), 403

            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator

# User registration
@app.route('/signup', methods=['POST'])
def signup():
    data = request.json
    username = data.get('username')
    password = data.get('password')

    if username in users:
        return jsonify({"message": "User already exists"}), 409

    # Hash the password
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
    users[username] = {"password": hashed_password, "role": data.get("role", "user")}
    return jsonify({"message": "User registered successfully!"}), 201

# User login and JWT generation
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.json
    username = data.get('username')
    password = data.get('password')

    user = users.get(username)
    if user and bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), user['password']):
        payload = {
            "username": username,
            "role": user["role"],
            "exp": datetime.datetime.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(hours=1)  # Token expiration time
        }
        token = jwt.encode(payload, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithm="HS256")
        return jsonify({"token": token})

    return jsonify({"message": "Invalid credentials"}), 401

# Auth required decorator
def auth_required(f):
    @wraps(f)
    def decorator(*args, **kwargs):
        token = request.headers.get('Authorization')
        if not token:
            return jsonify({"message": "Token is missing!"}), 401

        try:
            token = token.split(" ")[1]  # Split 'Bearer <token>'
            decoded_token = jwt.decode(token, app.config['SECRET_KEY'], algorithms=["HS256"])
            request.user = decoded_token  # Store decoded token in request context
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            return jsonify({"message": "Token has expired!"}), 403
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return jsonify({"message": "Invalid token!"}), 403

        return f(*args, **kwargs)
    return decorator

# Protected route for users
@app.route('/user', methods=['GET'])
@auth_required
def user():
    return jsonify({"message": f"Hello {request.user['username']}, you have user access."})

# Protected route for admins
@app.route('/admin', methods=['GET'])
@auth_required
@role_required("admin")
def admin():
    return jsonify({"message": f"Hello Admin {request.user['username']}!"})

# Starting the Flask app
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Key Features

1. **JWT Authentication**:  
   The app uses JWT for authentication. Users can log in by providing their username and password. If the credentials are correct, a JWT is returned.

2. **Role-Based Authorization**:  
   The `role_required` decorator is used to restrict access to certain routes based on the user's role (e.g., only admin users can access `/admin`).

3. **Auth Required Decorator**:  
   The `auth_required` decorator ensures that only users with a valid JWT can access protected routes.

---
### Form of JWT in Authorization Header

In a request, the **Authorization header** will look like this:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

Where `<your_jwt_token>` is the JWT string generated by the server.
The client includes this token in the header for each protected request.
The server decodes and verifies the token to grant access to the protected resource.  

---

## JWT Security Considerations

- **Secret Key Security**: Store your secret key securely (e.g., in environment variables). Never hard-code it in the codebase.
- **Token Expiry**: Set an expiration (`exp`) claim to ensure that tokens are short-lived. This limits the damage in case a token is compromised.
- **Token Revocation**: Since JWTs are stateless, revoking a JWT before its expiration is challenging. Implement token blacklists or reduce token expiry time to mitigate this risk.
- **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to prevent JWTs from being intercepted during transmission.
- **Payload Size**: Avoid storing sensitive information in the payload. Keep the payload size small to reduce the risk of exposure.
- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose a strong algorithm (e.g., HS256, RS256) for signing the JWTs.
- **Token Storage**: Avoid storing JWTs in local storage due to XSS vulnerabilities. Use HTTP-only cookies for storing tokens.
- **Token Scope**: Limit the scope of the token to only include necessary information. Avoid including sensitive data in the token payload.
- **Token Renewal**: Implement token renewal mechanisms to provide a seamless user experience without requiring frequent logins.

### Summary 

This implementation covers the essential aspects of JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization in a Flask application. With decorators for authentication and authorization, you can easily manage access control in your API
Make sure to follow best practices regarding secret key management, token expiration, and HTTPS to secure your application effectively.
